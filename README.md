This project is based on a course in Coursera 'Front-end development with React' by Jogesh.K.Muppala 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used json server for intial development of the project and then integrated the React App with the Node.Js backend.
The webApp has different pages like home,dishes,and others which are navigated using React-Router package
